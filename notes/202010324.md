# Zero-knowledge proofs (of statements)

## ZKP analysis

- Completness proof assumes both parties are honest / correct
- Soundness assumes prover dishonest, verifier honest
- Zero-knowledge assumes prover honest, verifier dishonest / malicious

## ZKP for graph isomorphism

Recall algorithm from last lecture.

### Completness

If `G_0 =~ G_1` (isomorphic) then V always accepts

### Soundness

If `G_0 ! =~ G_1` then V rejects with probability at least 1/2.
A cheating prover may also succeed with probability `<= 1/2`. This is called
the soundness error.

To reduce it to `2^(-k)`, repeat the protocol `k` times.

Intuition:
- If P could answer both challenges, then the statement must be true
- If we model both as machines (turing machines, virtual machines) then one can
  take a snapshot of their state after P has sent the first message (the
  commitment), run the protocol to completion and repeatedly restart from the
  snapshot, until V picks a different challenge (b).

  This gives V both permutations Rho_0 and Rho_1, `G_0 =~ H (wrt Rho_0)`, `G_1
  =~ H (wrt Rho_1)`. So, V could 'extract' the isomorphism between `G_0` and
  `G_1`.
- Only a thought experiment for the proof, not IRL

### Zero-knowledge

What is 'computational knowledge'?

If a party can generate a random variable with exactly the same (or an
indistinguishable) distribution, the party gains no information from T. (The
transcript of all messages).

Here, V can generate (simulate) a transcript T of an accepting protocol
execution.

- Same distribution `<=>` perfect ZK, 
- Computationally indistinguishable `<=>` computational ZK

V can simulate transcript T:
```
1. b' <- {0, 1}
2. rho' := random permutation of V
3. H' = rho'(G_b'), ie isomorphic to G_b'
```

Distribution (H, b, rho) in real protocol same as (H', b', rho') in simulated
execution.

Hence V learns no information through this protocol which it could not have
figured out anyway.

V hence cannot transfer an observed proof by the proover to a third party.

## Applications of ZKP

What can be proved 'in zero knowledge'?

- Graph isomorphism problem, which is believed to be between the complexity
  classes of P and NP (evidence not in NP, and not in P), like the problems of
  factorization or DLP.
- If one NP-complete problem has a ZKP, then any NP-complete problem has one
  (in polynomial time)
- 3-colorability of a graph G is NP-complete and has a ZKP

Using these to eg authenticate online works in principle but not in practice,
due to a) the size of the parameters and b) multiple rounds needed for safety.
Much more efficient schemes exist.

# ZKPK: Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge

Goal: Prove knowledge of secrets alpha, beta, gamma ... known to the prover,
such that some predicate `psi(alpha, beta, gamma, ...)` holds.

## Example

Prover P proves that it knows DLP alpha of a public value `y`, such that
`g^alpha = y`.

### Notation

```
PK{(alpha, beta, ...) : psi(alpha, beta, ...) }
```

Where `alpha, heta, ...` known to the prover P only.
Eg:
```
PK{ (alpha) : y = g^alpha }
```

## Formalizing ZKPK

- 3-move protocols or sigma protocols
```
P(alpha, beta)      psi          v
  -- commitment -->
  <-- challenge c --           c <- rho
```

With proof of statement: Question was whether something exists.
Now: Less so. Eg there is always an x such that `g^x = y` for a `y in <g> = G`.
The statement is guaranteed to hold for some x.

So to convince V, P must demonstrate that it knows the specific x.

Formalization: Ability of V to extract secret alpha, beta, ... from P.

Using extractor E, an efficient algorithm, such that it extracts the secrets
alpha, beta, ... from P, when given two accepting protocol runs (transcripts)
with the same commitment. Ie requires ability to rewind / should not show up in
ordinary execution. (So no 'danger' to ZK property).

## Definition

A ZKPK is a three-move protocol for a relation Phi, satisfying:

- Completness: If P has input x satisfying Phi(x), then a correct V always accepts

- Soundness: There exists an efficient extractor E, such that `E((t, c, s), (t,
  c', s')) -> x`, when `c != c', s != s'` and `Phi(x)` holds (t is equal
  commitment for both)

- Zero-knowledge: V can simulate transcripts `(t, c, s)` on its own, with same
  (or indistinguishable) distribution. That is exists simulator S which
  produces `(t, c, s)`, but may use a different generation order.

## ZKPK of a discrete logarith ("Schnorr proof")

Again, `G = <g>` of order q. `Phi(x) : g^x = y`.

```
P(x)                                    V
r <- Z_q
t := g^r  --- t, commitment --->
         <--- c, challenge ---        c <- Z_q
s := r - xc --- s, response --->      verify g^s * y^c = t
```

### Analysis

Completness
``
If P and V honest, then t = g^r = g^(r - cx + cx) = g^s * g^(xc) = g^s y^c

Then V accepts
``

### Soundness

```
Two executions with (t, c, s), (t, c', s'), note `c != c'`.

=> t = g^s y^c = g^s' y^c'
<=> g^(s-s') = y^(c' - c) = g^(x (c'-c))
<=> s - s' \equiv x(c' - c) (mod q)
<=> x \equiv (s - s')/(c' - c) (mod q)
```

### Zero-knowledge?

```
V chooses triplets (t, c, s) on its own:
c <- Z_q
s <- Z_q
t := g^s y^c
```

Such a transcript has exactly the same distribution as an actual transcript of
an accepting execution of the protocol.

## Commitment schemes

A commitment scheme is defined as:
```
KeyGen() -> pk
  probabilistic

Com(pk, x, r) -> c
  deterministic
  outputs commitment c in {0, 1}^*
  x in {0, 1}^*
  r in R, randomness, choose r <- R by S

Ver(pk, x, r, c) -> True / False
  deterministic, output indicates whether 
```

### Completness

```
For pk := KeyGen(), forall x in {0, 1}^*, forall r in R:
Ver(pk, x, r, Com(pk, x, r)) = True
```

### Binding

Security for R against S
```
For pk := KeyGen(), no S' can produce (x, r) and (x', r') with x != x', such that 
Ver(pk, x, r, c) = True = Ver(pk, x', r', c)
```

For computationally binding commitment: No computationally bounded S' can
produce ... except with neglibible probability.

### Hiding

Security for S, against R

```
For pk := KeyGen(), for all x0, x1 in {0, 1}^*
b <- {0, 1}
c := Com(pk, x_b, r) for r <- R

Then no R' can guess b with more than probability 1/2
```

For computationally hiding: No computationally bounded R' can guess b with more
than probability 1/2 + epsilon
