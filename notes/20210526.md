# 10.1 Authenticated data structures (ADS)

Recall:
- Untrusted server
- One writer
- n readers
- Authenticated (+ integrity) backchannel (not necessarily confidential) between
  writer and readers

## Formalization

- X: States, stored on server
- O: Operations, initiated by clients
- R: Responses, sent to clients
- F: (x, o) -> (x', r), given current state and operation, leads to new state and response

## Goal

Minimize data sent between clients and server. Naive approach would have every
client keep a full copy of the DB, with the writer communicating signed
operations.

## Two kinds of operations

- Updates U subset O: Empty response, new state
- Queries Q subset O: Response to client, do not change state

## Syntax of ADS

Server:
- `Refresh_F()` // Update its own representation in response to update operation
- `Query_F()` // Return something in response to query operation

Clients:

Writer:
- `KeyGen()`
- `Init_F()`
- `Update_F()`


### Writer

```
KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)

Init_F(sk, x) -> (x', alpha)
  x': Encoded state x // Assume x' can be recreated by writer whenever needed, based on x
  alpha: Authenticator

Update_F(sk, x', alpha, u) -> (x'^, alpha')
  Update changes state and authenticator, to be sent to clients
```

### Server

```
Refresh_F(pk, x', alpha, u) -> (x'^, (alpha'))
  Re-executes update n
  May not necessarily produce new alpha

Query_F(pk, x', alpha, q) -> (r, phi)
  - Produces a response r for query q, and a "proof" phi
```

### Reader

```
Verify_F(pk, alpha, q, r, phi) -> {0, 1}
  Output whether response to query is correct
```

### Properties

#### Completness

After `KeyGen()` and `Init_F()`, run any sequence f calls to `Update_F()` and
`Refresh_F()` methods that produce `x, x'` and `alpha`.

Then, for any `q` and `r, phi := Query_F(pk, x', alpha, q)`, we have:
- `Verify_F(pk, alpha, q, r, phi) = 1` IFF `F(x, q) = (x, r)`

#### Security

After `KeyGen()` and `Init_F()`, run any sequence f calls to `Update_F()` and
`Refresh_F()` methods that produce `x, x'` and `alpha`.

It is computationally infeasible for any adversary A to forge a values `q, r,
phi` such that `Verify_F(pk, alpha, q, r, phi) = 1`, and `F(x, q) != (x, r)`.

#### Efficiency

Size of authenticator must be much smaller than size of state

# Hash trees as ADS

- Aka Merkle trees (by Ralph Merkle)
- Use a cryptographic hash function `H: {0, 1}^* -> {0, 1}^lambda`
  - Which is collision-free

Tree structure:
```
h_root = H(h_0 || h_1)
h_0    = H(h_00 || h_01)
h_1    = H(h_10 || h_11)
...
                h_00
               /
          h_0--
          /    \ h_11
         /
        /
h_root---
         \
          h_1 ...
```

Intermediary nodes contain hash value computed from its `n` children's values,
`h_c = H(h_c0 || ... h_cn)`. Note that tree not necessarily binary, `n > 2` for
efficiency.

Leaf nodes contain hashes of (large) data chunks.

## Hash-tree ADS

Goal: Authenticating an array `X = (x_1, ..., x_n)` of data points stored on
our server.

F has operations `read(i) -> x_i` and `write(i, v)`


```
KeyGen(): Not needed

Init_F(x):
  - Compute hash tree on x_1, ..., x_n
  - Let x' consist of x_1, ..., x_n plus all nodes of the three
  - alpha := root of hash tree
  - return(x', alpha)

Idea: Reader has to efficiently recompute path from leaf node to root node. (yellow)

Query_F(x', alpha, q):
  - Operation q is read(i)
  - Phi consists of all sibling nodes along our path from leaf node i to the
    root node (red)
  - return(x_i, phi)

Verify_F(alpha, q, x_i, phi):
  - Recompute candidate root hash value `H(q)`, starting at x_i, using all
    sibling values in phi
  - Return H(q) == alpha

Update_F(... u ...):
  - Operation u is write(i, v)
  - x_i := v
  - Recompute h_root, and all nodes along the path from node i to the root node
```

Note: Sibling data needn't be stored in an authenticated way. A cheating server
will only hurt itself.

## Properties of hash-tree ADS

Completness: Clear

Security:
- Adversary A breaks security if it produces `q, r, phi` which pass
  verification `Verify_F(..., alpha, q, r, phi) == 1`, and `F(x, q) != r`
  - Note that adversary cannot produce alpha, that is given by the hash
    sequence of operations known to all clients. Dito x, which is the state of
    the hash tree.
  This happens IFF somewhere along the path, two hash operations on different
  inputs produced the same input. This does not happen (to a bounded
  adversary), as the hash function is collision-resistant.

Efficiency:
  - Extra storage: `O(n)` storage.In practice not too bad, as n-ary trees used,
    and hash values small compared to actual data.
  - Authenticator is small, one hash value so `lambda` bits
  - Proof size is small, O(log(n) * lambda)
  - Update, refresh, query, verify operations have to do `O(log(n))` steps
    These will be primarily hash operations, which are fast

## Dynamic accumulator as ADS

### Recall RSA

```
KeyGen()
  p, q prime
  N = pq
  e = fixed prime
  d = e^{-1} (mod phi(N))
```

Ordinary RSA assumption: Given `N, e` as above, `x <- Z_N`, it is infeasible to
compute `y such that y = x^e (mod N)`.

### Strong RSA assumption

Given `N` from `KeyGen()`, `x <- Z_N`, it is infeasible to compute `y` and `z`
such that `y^z \equiv x (mod N)` and `z >= 3, prime`.

This gives more flexibility to an adversary, ie adversary allowed to pick
public exponent.

## Accumulator based on RSA

(Camenisch and Lysyanskaya)

Let `H: {0, 1}^* -> SetNat` a cryptographic hash function that outputs distinct
primes.

Idea:
```
alpha \equiv r^{ H(x_1) * ... * H(x_n) } (mod N)
```

Note: alpha authenticates `x_1, ... x_n` in *arbitrary* order (respectively as
unordered set). Reordering elements does not change alpha!

This is generally a **feature**, a so-called 'history-free' data structure.
To add order, use:
```
alpha \equiv r^{ H(1 || x_1) * ... * H(n || x_n) } (mod N)
```
