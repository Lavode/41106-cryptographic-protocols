# More proofs of knowledge

Recall ZKPK of DL: `PK { (alpha) : y = g^alpha }`

Multiple bases / generators, such that DL 'among them' are unknown. (Details
follow).

## Proof of representation

Given `g_1, ..., g_n`, prove knowledge of `alpha_1, ..., alpha_n` such that:
`y = g_1^{alpha_1} * ... * g_n^{alpha_n}`
Where `DL_{g_i}(g_j)` is unknown.

`PK{ (alpha_1, ..., alpha_n) : y = g_1^{alpha_1} ... g_n^{alpha_n}` }

```
# Ease of notation: alpha_i == x_i
P(x_1, ..., x_n)                                 V(y)

for i := 1 to n do:
  r_i <- Z_q

t := product(g_i^{r_i}) --- t -->
                        <--- c --                c <- Z_q

for i := 1 to n do:
  s_i := r_i - c*x_i
                       --- s_1, ..., s_n -->     verify:
                                                 t == product(g_i^(s_i)) * y^c
```


### Completness

If P and V are honest, then:
```
t = product( g_i^{r_i}) ) = product( g_i^{r_i - c*x_i + c*x_i} )
  = product( g_i^{s_i} * g_i^{c*x_i} )
  = product( g_i^{s_i} ) * y^c
```

### Soundness

Given two accepting executions `(t, c, s_1, ..., s_n), (t, c', s_1', ...,
s_n')`, one can find `x_1, ..., x_n` such that `y = product(g_i^(x_i))`

=> Exercise

### Zero-knowledge

=> Exercise

### Why do we want this

Consider additively-homomorphic ElGamal: x encrypted as `(g^r, g^x * y^r) = (R,
C)`

As a prover I can prove that I know what's inside a ciphertext (I encrypted)
without revealing what's inside. Only makes sense if verifier is not the party
with the secret key, then they could just decrypt.

## Proof of equality (EQ)

P wants to convince V that `DL_{g_1}(y_1) = DL_{g_2}(y_2)`. Ie P knows `x` such
that `g_1^x = y_1, g_2^x = y_2`: `PK { (alpha) : y_1 = g_1^alpha AND y_2 = g_2^alpha }`

```
P                                         V

r <- Z_q
t_1 := g_1^r
t_2 := g_2^r
                --- t_1, t_2 --->
                <--- c ---                c <- Z_q
s := r - cx     ---- s --->               verify:
                                          t_1 = g_1^s * y_1^c
                                          t_2 = g_2^s * y_2^c
```

### Completness

If P and V honest, then
```
for i := 1 to 2:
  t_i = g_i^r = g_i^{r - cx + cx} = g_i^s * g_i^{xc} = g_i^s * y_i^c
```

### Soundness

Two transcripts `(t_1, t_2, c, s), (t_1, t_2, c', s')` are sufficient to
extract the value `x` such that `g_1^x = y_1 AND g_2^x = y_2`.

```
t_1 = g_1^s * y_1^c = g_1^s' * y_1^c'
t_2 = g_2^s * y_2^c = g_2^s' * y_2*c'

=>

g_1^{s-s'} = y_1^{c' - c}
g_2^{s-s'} = y_2^{c' - c}

=>

let x_1' : y_1 = g_1^(x_1')
let x_2' : y_2 = g_3^(x_2')

Then:
(s - s') / (c' - c) \equiv x_1' (mod q)
(s - s') / (c' - c) \equiv x_2' (mod q)

So:

# Abstracting ZKPK

`PK{ (x) : Phi(y, x) }`

```
P(x)                            V(y)

(t, r) := Commit(y)
       --- t -->                c <- challenge()
       <-- c ---
s := response(x, y, t, r)
       --- s --> verify(y, t, c, s) == True
```

## Proof of conjuction (AND)

`PK { (x) : Phi_1(y, x) AND Phi_2(y, x) }`

Idea: Use same challenge in two parallel proofs.

## Proof of disjuction (OR)

`PK { (x_1, x_2) : Phi_1(y_1, x_1) OR Phi_2(y_2, x_2) }`

NB this is general. More specific cases:
- If `x_1 = x_2` then proof that `x_1` fulfills one of the two predicates
- If `Phi_1 = Phi_2` then proof that one of the `x_i` fulfills the predicate

Suppose P wants to prove `Phi_1(y_1, x_1) OR Phi_2(y_2, x_2)`, but P only knows
`x_b` for  `b in {1, 2}`, but not `x_b'`.

```
P(x_b)                                                       V
(t_b, r_b) := commit(y_b)

fake proof for x_b':
  c_b' := challenge()
  (t_b', r_b', s_b') := simulate(y_b', c_b') // Exists as we use a ZKP as basis
                                     --- t_1, t_2 -->
                                     <--- c ---           c := challenge()
  c_b := c + c_b' // c_b' fixed as chosen before. Computation in some group eg Z_q

  s_b := response(x_b, y_b, t_b, r_b, c_b)
                                       --- c_1, s_1, c_2, s_2) --> verify(y_1, t_1, c_1, s_1) AND
                                                                   verify(y_2, t_2, c_2, s_2)
```

# Making ZKP non-interactive

Goal: One message from prover to verifier.

Note: Challenge is something which must look random, and which the prover
cannot influence. Replace challenge with hash function operating on commitment.

Called "Fiat-Shamir transform"

## Example

- Take DL proof (Schnorr proof)
- (Optional) add context, or message m
  Apply FS-transform: `c := H(t || m)`, where `m` is the 'context'
- Output simulated transcript `(t, s)` of ZKPK (DL)

=> This yields a Schnorr signature here
=> More generally, gives an arbitrary non-interactive ZKPK for some statement

# Commitment schemes

```
KeyGen() -> pk // Usually ran by trusted entity which has to be honest

Commit(pk, x, r) => c // r uniformly random from some space, x the thing we commit to

Verify(pk, x, r, c) => True/False // Whether c is a valid commitment for x
```

## Completness

Forall x, `Verify(pk, x, Commit(pk, x, r)) = True`

## Binding

No adversary can create `(x, r, c)` and `(x', r', c)`, `x != x'`, such that
both verify.

## Hiding

Receiver does not obtain useful information about value x to which the sender
commited. (Even with *infinite* computing power, comparable to eg OTP). All
values of x are equally likely.

## DLP based commitments

Given `G = <g>` where DLP is hard.

TODO: Fix based on lecture notes

```
KeyGen() => nil

Com(nil, x, r): // r <- Z_q (NB: Also holds if *not* chosen randomly from Z_q!)
  t := g^r
  c := H(t) XOR x

  return c

Ver(nil, x, r, c):
  retun (H(g^r) XOR c) == x
```

## Peterson commitments

`G = <g> = <h>`

Need to assume g and h are guaranteed to be independent - trust a third-party
entitity.

```
KeyGen()
  h <- G
  return h

Com(h, x, r) // r <- Z_q, must be uniformly random
  return g^x * h^r

Ver(h, x, r, c)
  return c = g^x * h^r
```

### Completness

Trivial

### Binding

If malicious sender S can 'open' commitment c using `(x, r)` and `(x', r')`
such that `c = g^x h^r = g^x' h^r'` then it could also compute `DL_g(h)`.

Not possible if `g, h` independent and DLP holds, computationally binding. (As
opposed to unconditionally binding as in the ElGamal one)

### Hiding

TODO fix from lecture notes
