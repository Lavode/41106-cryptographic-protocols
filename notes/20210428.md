# Yao's garbled circuits

Recall: Given binary gate, every of the four possible combinations of inputs is
represented as a token (long key). With proper key you can decrypt the
corresponding encrypted output for the input pair.

## Completness

- Once Bob has token for each input (by means of OT), he has correct keys
- Then able to evaluate

## Security for A

- Bob does not learn of tokens for anything except his inputs, due to 2-1 OT
- Bob also learns nothing about interpretation of tokens (ie cleartext meaning)
  except where it follows from the function f and his own input (recall `x AND
  1` identifying x)

## Security for B

- Alice will not learn of Bob's inputs due to security of 2-1 OT

## Cost

- PK Operations: `O(|y|)`, y being Bob's input to circuit
- Bits exchanged: `O(|C| * lambda)`
- Latency (communication rounds): `O(1)`, namely exactly 3 rounds

## Robustness

- Alice could introduce incorrect value which fails to decrypt for certain
  inputs of Bob, learning of Bob's input

Robust version exists (eg using ZKPK), but will not be discussed.

# Modular protocol for 2PC (GMW Protocol)

By Goldreich, Micali, Wigderson, "How to play any mental game", STOC 1987.

- Yao's protocol uses special (non-standard) encryption scheme, does not generalize easily
- GMW is more modular, generalizes to multi-party computation easily

GMW uses only XOR operations, and OT as a black box.

Idea:
1) Uses 2-of-2 secret sharing for each value on a wire in C:
   `Share(x) = (r, r XOR x) = (S_a, S_B)` where `r <- {0, 1}`
   Where `S_A` is given to A, `S_B` to B
   This is *sharing* of x:
   - `S_A, S_B` do not give information about x, as in OTP
   - Both together give `x = S_A XOR S_B`
2) use OT to evaluate each gate in C

## GMW Protocol

Goal: Compute `z = f(x, y)`, where `C` is circuit for f consisting of NOT, XOR, AND gates

### 1. Share inputs (NB index offset "+l" for B to prevent conflict)

```
A(x in {0, 1}^l)                                                     B(y in {0, 1}^l)

for j = 1 to l:                                                      for j = 1 to l
  S^A_j <- {0, 1}                                                      S^A_{l+j} <- {0, 1}
  S^B_j = x_j XOR S^A_j                                                S^B_{l+j} = y_j XOR S^A_{l+j}

                               ----- S^B_i forall i --->
                               <---- S^B_{l+i} forall i ---
```


### 2. For each gate in C
- According to a topological order

#### XOR

```
t = XOR(i, j):

A holds S^A_i, S^A_j
B holds S^B_i, S^B_j

Such that:
- w_i = S^A_i XOR S^B_i
- w_j = S^A_j XOR S^B_j

Now w_t = w_i XOR w_j
        = S^A_i XOR S^B_i XOR S^A_j XOR S^B_j
        = (S^A_i XOR S^A_j) XOR (S^B_i XOR S^B_j)
        = S_t
```

Rearranging allows using purely local computation.

- A computes `S^A_t = S^A_i XOR S^A_j`
- B computes `S^B_t = S^B_i XOR S^B_j`

No exchange of messages, afterwards both have their share of the output.

#### NOT

```
t = XOR(i)

A holds S^A_i
B holds S^A_i

Such that:
w_i = S^A_i XOR S^B_i
```

- A computes `S^A_t = NOT S^A_i`
- B computes `S^B_t = S^B_i`

Then `S^A_t XOR S^B_t = NOT (S^A_i XOR S^A_i)`

#### AND

```
t = AND(i, j)

A holds S^A_i, S^A_j
B holds S^B_i, S^B_j

Such that
- w_i = S^A_i XOR S^B_i
- w_j = S^A_j XOR S^B_j
```

TODO: Review from lecture notes

A picks `S^A_t: = r <- {0, 1}` to mask output `w_t`
B should receive `S^B_t := w_t XOR r`

Let `S(S^B_i, S^B_j) := w_t = (S^A_i XOR S^B_i) AND (S^A_j XOR S^B_j)` for
fixed values `S^A_i` and `S^A_j`, computed by A.

```
S^B_i, S^B_j, S(S^B_i, S^B_j), S^B_t
0      0      S(0, 0)          r XOR S(0, 0)
0      1      S(0, 1)          r XOR S(0, 1)
1      0      S(1, 0)          r XOR S(1, 0)
1      1      S(1, 1)          r XOR S(1, 1)
```

A and B use (4-1) OT to send `S^B_t` from A to B
```
S^B_t ------------> (4-1) OT <----------- S^B_i, S^B_j
                      |
                      -------------------> S(S^B_i, S^B_j) XOR r =: S^B_t
```

### Output wires

A sends `{s^A_o}, o in Output` to B

B calculates `w_o = S^A_o XOR S^B_o for o in output`
B sends `S^B_o` to Alice

A calculates `w_o = S^B_0 XOR S^A_o for o in output`

### Completness, Security

Not discussed in details

### Cost

- Public-key operations: `O(|C|)`
- Communication bits `O(|C|)`
- Latency `O(depth(C))`, higher than Yao's

Depth is longest path for any input to an output, counting only AND gates (as non-local)

## Sketch of generalization to n parties

Parties `P_1, ..., P_n`

Use additive sharing in `n-out-of-n` model:
- `(x_1, ..., x_n) = Share(x)`, with `x_i` given to `P_i`
- `x_i in {0, 1}`, for `i = 1 to n-1`
- `x_n = x XOR x_1 XOR ... XOR x_{n-1}`

Then a value `w_i` on wire i is represented by `n` shares `s_1, ..., s_n` where
`P_i` holds `s_i`, that is `(s^1_i, ..., s^n_i) = Share(w_i)`.

Protocol is as before, except for the AND gates.

### AND gates

More interaction:
```
w_t = w_i AND w_j
    = (XOR for k = 1 to n: s^k_i) AND (XOR for k = 1 to n: s^k_j)
    = (XOR for k = 1 to n: s^k_i AND s^k_j) XOR (XOR for k, l  = 1, k != l: s^k_i AND s^l_j)
```

- `P_k` can compute `s_k_i AND s^k_j` locally
- `P_k` and `P_l` use 2-out-of-2 sharing to compute `S^k_i AND S^l_j` using
  two-party protocol as discussed before, using a 4-1 OT.

### Cost

- Will be costly, as `O(n^2)` OTs needed
- But shows that it is feasible

# Distributed cryptography

- Group of no participants
- Cryptographic scheme should be secure as long as no more than t of the
  parties are corrupt

# Secret sharing

- Dealer `D` shares a secret s among group `P_1, ..., P_n`
- Any `t+1` of parties can recover s
- No group of `t` parties has any information on `s`

Assume `s in GF(q)`. Dealer picks a random polynomial `f(x)` of degree `t` over
`GF(q)`, such that `f(0) = s`.

D gives `s_i = f(i)` to `P_i`. Any subset `S subset {1, ..., n}` with `|S| = t=1` can
recover `f(0)` using Lagrange interpolation.

```
s = f(0) = Sum (for i in S) lambda^s_{0, i} * s_i
Where lambda^s_{0, i} = Product (for j in S, j != i) [ j / (j-i) ] // Check textbook
```

## Completness

Follows from algebra

## Security

Does not hold for real numbers! Based on finite fields.
