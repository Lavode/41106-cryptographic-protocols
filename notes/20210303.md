## 2.1 Programs as circuits


Every program on inputs `x_1, ..., x_n` computes a function `f(x_1, ..., x_n)`.
Represented by a Turing machine or by a circuit.

### Cook-Levin Theorem

Every problem decided by a non-deterministic turing machine (an NP-problem) in
polynomial time can be formulated as the satisfiability problem (SAT) of a
polynomial-size circuit

### Circuit for given problem

From computer architecture we know that every computation is represented and
carried out by binary stateful circuits.

Here we formulate all programs as circuits, and evaluate these in 'encrypted'
form.

#### Test equality of two binary numbers

Given `x = x_{n-1} ... x_0`, `y = y_{n-1} ... y_0`, determine if they are
equal.

```
i := n - 1

while i >= 0:
  if x_i != y_i:
    return false
  i := i - 1

return true
```

In circuit we must unroll the loop and execute all iterations of the loop.

```
i := n - 1
d_n := 0

while i >= 0:
  d_i := d_{i+1} OR (x_i XOR y_i)
  i := i - 1

return !d_0 // 0 = false, 1 = true
```

Mind: Conversion to circuit (for encryption purposes) only works with programs
which terminate in polynomial time. (Specifically also no infinite loops!)

## 2.2 Mathematics of public-key crypto

- Modular arithmetic
- `Z_m`: Additive group of integers modulo m = {0, ..., m - 1}, with modular
  addition
- `Z_p^*`: Multiplicative group of integers modulo p = {1, ..., p - 1}, with
  modular exponentiation
- A group G is a set with an operation and a neutral element
- A finite group G is cyclic if there exists a generator g in G, and every
- element g' in G can be represented as g^x for some power x.
- g^0, g^1, ..., g^{|G| - 1} = g^0
- `G = <g>`, g is generator of G
- `Z_m` integers mod m with addition is cyclic
- `Z_11^*`: `<3> = {1, 3, 9, 5, 4} != Z_11^*`, `<2>_11 = Z_11^*`
- `Z_p^*` is cyclic for any prime p with `|Z_p^*| - p-1`
- If `q | p - 1` with q prime, then a cyclic group of order `q` is defined by
  multiplication modulo p => Used in crypto, with `|p| ~= 2000`, `|q| ~= 256`


### Discrete logarithm

- Computing logarithm is inverse of exponentiation Given `G = <g>`, the
  discrete log of some y in G is the number i such that `g^i = y` Eg G subset
  of `Z_p^*`, then such that `g^i \equiv y mod p`. In non-modular case trivial.

DLP: Given `y = g^x <- Z_q`, the DLP is to compute `x`

CDH (computational Diffie-Hellman): Given `x, y such that x=g^a for a <- Z_q,
y=g^b for b <- Z_q`, compute `g^(a*b)`

DDH (decisional Diffie-Hellman): Differentiate `g^a, g^b, g^(a*b)` from `g^a,
g^b, g^c`, for `a, b, c <- Z_q`

### Public-key encryption

- `KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)` public key and secret key
- `Enc(pk, m) -> c` public key pk, message m, ciphertext c
- `Dec(sk, c) -> m'`, secret key sk, message m'

- Completness: `Dec(sk, Enc(pk, m)) = m` forall m
- Security (very informal here): No information about encrypted m should be
  inferred from knowledge of ciphertext.
  Example: Ciphertext should look like random element from domain.
  Weaker: For two known messages m1, m2 no adversary can distinguish c1, c2


### El Gamal

```
KeyGen()
  x <- Z_q
  y := g^x
  return (y, x)

Enc(y, m):
  r <- Z_q
  R := g^r
  c := m*y^r
  return (R, C)

Dec(x, (R, C)):
  m' := C/R^x
  return m'
```

Completness:
```
m' = C/R^x = m*y^r / R^x = m*g^xr / g^rx = m
```

Security:
Decide differentiate, for some `m`, `(g^x, g^r, m*g^(xr))` from `(g^x, g^r,
m*g^z)` for some `z <- Z_q`

### RSA cryptosystem

Here exponentiation modulo `N = p*q`, p, q prime. In practice, `|p| ~= |q| ~=
1000`.

- `Z_N^*`: Ring of integers mod `N` which are coprime with `N = pq`.
- `|Z_N^*| = phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1)`

#### Euler's theorem

For all `a in Z_N^*`, it holds that `a^{phi(N)} \equiv 1 mod N`

#### Cryptosystem

```
KeyGen():
  p, q <- random primes
  N := p*q
  e (fixed) exponent, prime
  d := e^{-1} mod phi(N)

  return ((N, e), d)

Enc((N, e), m):
  c := m^e mod N
  return c

Dec(d, c):
  return c^d mod N
```

Completness:
```
Dec(d, Enc((N, e), m)) = c^d \equiv m^{de} m^{e*e^{-1}} \equiv m mod N
```
