# Oblivious transfer

Previously: (2-1) OT from S to R.

NB: Research went into whether eg able to build OT-of-strings from OT-of-bits.

## 2-1 OT from ElGamal

Idea: R prepares two public keys for a public-key cryptosystem `y_0, y_1` such
that it knows the private key only for `y_c`.  In the semi-honest model this is
not feasible, too easy to cheat.

Instead:
Given parameters of DLP-based cryptosystem (such as ElGamal):
- `G = <g>`
- `|G| = q`, prime
- `H: G -> {0, 1}^l`, hash function


```
S(x_0, x_1)                      R(c)
r <- Z_q
t := g^r      -- t -->
                                x_c <- Z_q
                                y_c := g^{x_c}
                                y_(1-c) = t/y_c
            <-- y_0, y_1 --

if y_0 * y_1 != t:
  abort

(R_0, C_0) = ElGamal-Enc(y_0, x_0)
(R_1, C_1) = ElGamal-Enc(y_1, x_1)
          -- (R_0, C_0, R_1, C_1) -->
                                z := ElGamal-Dec(x_c, R_c, C_c)
                                return z
```

### Completness

Clear because `R` knows `x_c`

### Security for S

`R` knows at most DL of `y_0` or `y_1` as product of the two was chosen by `S`.
Security of EG implies that `R` does not obtain information about other string.

### Security for R

`y_0, y_1` are *identically* distributed, nothing any adversary (even if
unbounded) would learn. Unconditional security.

TODO: Fix from lecture notes

```
A(x)                                      B(y)
      --- x ---> [ f(x, y) ] <--- y ---
                       |
                       ---------------> f(x, y)
```

## Examples

- Millionaire'se problem: `f(x, y) = (x >= y)`
- Public-key encryption with symmetric cryptosystem: `E(k, m) = f(k, m) = Enc(k, m)` given to B
- OPRF: `F(k, x)`
- Running an arbitrary encrypted program between the two:
  Given encrypted program P of B, input x of A.
  f(x, P) interpreter of program P in some language on inupt x
  f(x, P) = P(x)

## Toy example using OT

Implement millionaire's problem

TODO fix from lecture notes

Alice prepares `s_y = f(x, y)` for `y in Y`.
Sends `{s_y}` via `1-of-|Y|` OT to B.

`|X| = n = |Y|`.

```
A(x)                                    B(y)

s_0 = 1
s_1 = 1
...
s_x = 1
s_{x+1} = 0
...
s_{n-1} = 0
```

Does not wrok in general because with m-bit inputs of B one would need `2^m`
strings in OT.

## Towards Yao's garbled circuits construction

Introduce asymmetric encryption scheme which permits to check whether a key is
the correct key for decryption of a ciphertext.

Compare normal cryptosystem: No indication, can decrypt anything, will get
random output.

Eg `Dec*(k, c)` returns `nil` whenever ciphertext `c` was not produced as
`Enc(k, m)` for some message `m`.

- Could be authenticated encryption, ie a cryptosystem containing a MAC.
- Could be `Enc*(k, m) = Enc(k, m || 0^{\lambda})`

## Construction: Encrypt function table of f

For every `x in X`, `y in Y` compute `f(x, y)` and encrypt it in `T_{x, y}`

Idea:
- Represent every `x in X, y in Y` with a random key `k_x` and `k_y` respectively, for `Enc*`
- A encrypts `f(x, y)` in row `x,y` using `k_x` and `k_y`: `Enc*(k_x, Enc*(k_y, f(x, y)))`
- Transfer `k_y` (of B's input `y`) to B (OT, so A doesn't learn which input B chose)
- Transfer `k_x` to B (can do so directly, A knows its own input, B has no idea which input it is for)
- B tries to decrypt all entries, and succeeds in `f(x, y)`

QUESTION: Why does A encrypt f(x, y) for every possible x, y, rather than only f(x', y) for every possible y? Clearly A knows which x is the correct one, and encryption should prevent B from learning anything.

```
A(x')                                          B(y')
for x in X: k_x <- {0, 1}^lambda
for y in Y: k_y <- {0, 1}^lambda

for x, y in (X x Y):
  T_{x, y} = Enc*(k_x, Enc*(k_y, f(x, y)))

permute(T)

          ------- T, k_{x'} ------>

(k_1, ..., k_n) ------> (|Y|-1 OT) <--------  y'
                            |
                            ---------------> k_{y'}

                                             For t in T:
                                               if m = Dec*(k_x', Dec*(k_y', t)):
                                                 return m
                                                 // m = f(x', y')
```

### Completness

The only entry of T which will correctly decrypt is the one encrypting `f(x, y)`

### Security for A

Due to the OT protocol, B obtains no information about any `k_y*` for `y' != y*`. Plus security of encryption scheme protects other rows.

### Security for B

The receiver security of OT implies that A learns nothing about `y'`.

### Cost

- `m-1 OT` take m public-key operations
- B must decrypt all entries of `T` => `|X| * |Y|` operations
- A sends T of size `|X| * |Y| * l` bits to B

## Yao's garbled circuit protocol

Suppose `f(x, y)` is computable in polynomial time, then there exists a circuit
`C` with polynomially many AND, OR and NOT gates.

Example gate: `w_t = w_i AND w_j` with wires `i, j, t`.

```
-- i --|        |
       | Gate G |-- t --
-- j --|        |
```

Encrypt (garble) function table of each gate in C. Note how input domain of
each gate is `{0, 1} x {0, 1}`, ie of cardinality 4.
Represent each possible value on wire with keys for `Enc*`:
-  For `w_i`: `k_i^0, k_i^1`
-  For `w_j`: `k_j^0, k_j^1`
-  For `w_t`: `k_t^0, k_t^1`

For each combination of inputs, encrypt the corresponding output key with the
input keys (token).

```
T_G = [
          Enc*(k_i^0, Enc(k_j^0(k_t^(0 AND 0))))
          Enc*(k_i^0, Enc(k_j^1(k_t^(0 AND 1))))
          Enc*(k_i^1, Enc(k_j^0(k_t^(1 AND 0))))
          Enc*(k_i^1, Enc(k_j^1(k_t^(1 AND 1))))
      ]

```

Note `k_t^{0 AND 0} = k_t^0` and `k_t^{1 AND 1} = k_t^1`.

Evaluator obtains only one key for each wire.
With this key it can evaluate the next gate.


### Procedure to generate garbled circuit

```
Garble(C)
  for wire j in C:
    k_j^0 = {0, 1}^\lambda
    k_j^1 = {0, 1}^\lambda

  for gate G in C:
    T_G = garbled table w_t = G(w_i, w_j)

  permute(T)

  for output wire w_0:
    // 'Lookup table' for output keys
          { Enc*(k_0^0, 0)
    T_0 = {
          { Enc*(k_0^1, 1)

  return ({k}, {T_G}, {T_0})
```

### Procedure to evaluate garbled circuit (Yao's protocol)

```
A(x in {0, 1}^l)                                    b(y in {0, 1}^l)

1. GC := Garble(C)             --- GC --->

   x = (x_0, ..., x_{l-1})    

   Send tokens of input wires --- {k_i^{x_i}}

2. for j = 0 to l - 1: // All input bits of B
     -- k_j^0 --> | (2, 1)-OT | <-- y_j
     -- k_j^1 --> |           |
                        |
                        ----------> k_j^{y_j}

3. Evaluate the garbled circuit and deocde the output bits. Output value z = f(x, y)

Optionally send z to A.
```
