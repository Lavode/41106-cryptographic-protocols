# RSA accumulator


Remember: Hash function `H` which outputs primes.
Idea: Test if output of hash function is prime. If not, increment low-order
bits until it is.
- Still collision free due to density of prime function sufficiently large.

Accumulator: Witness of a set. Allows to verify claims of eg set memberhip.
The one discussed here: Can be dynamically updated, as elements are added and
removed from the set.

## Comparison of ADS

Hash trees preferred, as accumulator requires expensive public-key operations,
while a hash tree does not. So `O(log(n))` fast operations can be faster (in
seconds) than `O(1)` slow operations.
