## 2.4 Digital signatures

- Provides authenticity & integrity
- Dual to public-key encryption

### Digital signature scheme

```
KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)
Sign(sk, m) -> sigma
Verify(pk, m, sigma) -> true/false

Completness:
  Forall m, (pk, sk) <- KeyGen(): Ver(pk, m, Sign(sk, m)) = True

Security:
  Informal: No adversarary can create a message / signature pair which verifies without sigma having been output by sign(sk, m)
```

### Textbook RSA

Directly uses RSA function to produce signature. Not secure, but useful for
educational purposes.

```
KeyGen():
  p, q random large primes
  N := p * q
  e small prime
  d := e^{-1} (mod phi(N))

  return ((N, e), d)

Sign(d, m):
  return m^d mod N

Verify((N, e), m, sigma):
  m' := sigma^e mod N
  return m' == m
```

Not secure as malleable.

More secure: With hash function h.
Here: h is full-domain hash, ie its output is in `Z_N`
=> Using SHA256 with 2048 bit modulus not sufficient for FDH.
```
Sign(d, m):
  return h(m)^d mod N

Verify((n, e), m, sigma):
  return m' := sigma^e mod N
  return m' == h(m)
```

# 3. Blind signatures

Idea: Hide thing we are signing from signer

- Protocol between user A and signer B
- A inputs message m
- B has a signature scheme set up
- After protocol executes, A obtains a signature sigma, by B, of m
- B will not learn the message he signs, and not see any association between
  the information of the protocol and a signature seen later

Paper-based analogy:
- A takes piece of paper (message), puts in envelope lined with carbon paper,
  seals it and sends to Bob
- Bob signs on closed envelope (inherently signing the paper itself), returns envelope
- Alice can take message out of envelope, now has a signed message
- Only thing Bob knows is, how many times he signed something for Alice
  - But not which messages he signed
  - Nor, upon seeing a signature later, does he know from which signing
    operation this one was

Envelope == blinded message

## Blind signatures for RSA

```
KeyGen() as in RSA

A(m in {0, 1}^*)                                    B(sk)
r <- Z_N
h' := H(m) * r^e mod N   ---- h' ---->              
                         <--- s'  -----               s' := h'^d mod N
s := s' / r
// s is RSA signature on m



Verifier(pk):
// (as before)
Return s^e == H(m)
```

Completness:
```
s^e \equiv s'^e * r^{-e}
\equiv (h')^{de} * r^{-e}
\equiv h' * r^{-e}
\equiv H(m) * r^{e} * r^{-e}
\equiv H(m) (mod N)
```

Blindness: B signs a random number mod N

## Schnorr signatures

- Group `G = <g>`, cyclic finite group, `|G| = q` q prime, can be small, eg 256 bits
- G subset of `Z_p`, p prime, must be large eg 2048 bits
- p = m*q + 1
- DLP must be hard in G
- Hash function `H: {0, 1}^* -> Z_q`

```
KeyGen(): // Same as El Gamal
  x <- Z_q
  y := g^x
  return (y, x)

Sign(sk, m):
  r <- Z_q
  t := g^r
  c := H(m || t)
  s := r - c*x

  return (c, s)

Verify(pk, m, (c, s)):
  return c == H(m || g^s * y^c)
```

Completness:
```
H(m || g^s * y^c) = H(m || g^(r - c*x) * y^c) = H(m || g^(r - c*x) * g^(x*c)) = H(m || g^r) = H(m || t)
```

Security: Informal. One can prove that breaking this security (coming up with
message/signature pair which verifies) is equivalent to computing the DLP.

## Blind Schnorr signatures

More interactive than RSA - cannot just nicely blind final message.

```
Signing Protocol

User A                                             Signer B
m in {0, 1}^*                                      (pk, sk) // pk = y = g^x
                                                    r <- Z_q
                                                    t := g^r
                    <-- t -- 
alpha, beta <- Z_q
t' := t * g^(-alpha) * y^(-beta) // in Z_p
c' := H(m || t')
c := c' + beta // in Z_q
                    -- c -->
                                                    s := r - c*x
                    <-- s --
s' := s - alpha

return (c', s')
```

Verification:
```
Must be same as unblinded Schnorr
Ver(pk, m, (c', s')):
  return c' == H(m || g^(s') * y^(c'))

Works because:
t' = g^(s') * y^(c') = g^(s-alpha) * g^(x - c') = g^(r - cx - alpha + xc') = g^(r - x(c - c') - alpha) // Maybe typo?
   = g^(r + x*-beta - alpha)
   = t * g^(x * -beta) * g^(-alpha) 
   = t * y^(-beta) * g^(-alpha)
   = t'
```

Hence signature is ordinary Schnorr signature (so also secure), but blind.

Blindness:
```
B sees only H(m || ...) (during signature verification)
B sees H(m || ...) + beta, where beta is random blinding factor (during signature generation)
B sees (c', s') where c' = c-beta, s'=s-alpha

Signature is unlinkeable to signing protocol
```

## 3.x Anonymous digital cash

Paper from 1985 by Chaum.

Did not become reality as banks had little interest in privacy-preserving money
(but their cooperation would have been required, as they store money)

```
User A: wallet
Shop S: exchanges services for payment
Bank B: creates coins, stores balance for A and S
```

### Security goals:

Completness:
```
If A withdraws a coin from the bank
Then B debits it from the balance of A

If A transfers this coin ('spends') to S,
Then B credits it to the balance of S
```

Security:
```
B does not credit to S, unless B has issued this coin to some user X, and X has
transferred it to S

Ie: No forging of money, no double-spending of money
```

Anonymity:
```
If B credits a coin to some Y, then B can not link this coin to any of the
earlier withdrawal operations (no idea whose coin it is, like real cash)
```

Only thing bank knows is how many coins were issued => All coins must have the
same value.

If multiple coin denominations are required, there must be one public key for each

### Protocol to withdraw (issue) a coin

u: Unit, number of coins to transfer

```
User A:
  m <- {0, 1}^A // coin name, unique (if sufficiently large) bit string
  m' := blinded m // details later
  
  send msg (blind-sig, m', u) to B, run blinded signature-protocol
  
  Wait for (sig, m', sigma') from B
  sigma := unblind sigma'
  
  store (u, m, sigma)

Bank B:
  Upon receiving (blind-sig, m', u) from A:
    bal_A := bal_A - u
    run blind-sig protocol with A
    send (sig, m', sigma') to A
```

### Protocol to spend (transfer) a coin

- User A spends coin to S
- Each coin can only be spent once (keeps record of all coins which were spent, as they have unique names)

```
User A:
  Sends (spend, u, m, sigma) to S
  wait for (ack) or (nack) from S

Shop S:
  Upon receiving (spend, u, m, sigma) from A:
    send (deposit, u, m, sigma) to B
    wait for (result, b) from B
    if b = True:
      // deliver goods
      send (ack) to A
    else:
      // don't deliver goods
      send (nack) to A

Bank B:
  M := {} // Spent coins

  Upon receiving (deposit, u, m, sigma):
    If verify(pk_u, m, sigma) & m not in M:
      M := M U {m}
      bal_S += u
      send (result, true) to B
    else:
      send (result, false) to B
```
