# 4 Homomorphic encryption

Grand goal: Compute with encrypted data.

Cloud: (f, y)
- Secret program f
- Secret input y

User: (x)
- Secret input x
- Keypair pk, sk

- User computes cx = Enc(pk, x)
- Cloud compute cz = Enc(pk, (y, f, cx)) // Not syntactically correct
- User computes z = Dec(sk, cz)
- Completness: z = f(x, y)

=> Cloud and user each can have secret parameter, which is not exposed to the other party

## Single homomorphic encryption

Encryption scheme which allows operating on ciphertext in a way that you are
able to either *add* or *subtract* to the plaintext. That is there exists an
operation 'x' such that:
- `Enc(x) x Enc(y) = Enc(x + y)` // Additive homomorphic system
Or:
- `Enc(x) x Enc(y) = Enc(x * y)` // Multiplicative homomorphic system

Typically eg x, y in GF(2) (booleans), or GF(p). Such systems exist, eg RSA,
ElGamal, additively homomorphic ElGamal, Paillier scheme and are efficient.

## Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)

Encryption scheme with an operation x such that:
- `Enc(x) x Enc(y) = Enc(x + y)`
AND
Operation x' such that:
- `Enc(x) x' Enc(y) = Enc(x*y)`

Exist since 2009, Gentry. Lot of recent development, but not very efficient.
Theoretically able to implement any circuit, but not practical due to
performance.

## El-Gamal based SHE

Recall textbook ElGamal in `G = <g>`, `|G| = q, q prime`.

```
KeyGen():
  x <- Z_q
  y := g^x

  return (y, x)

Enc(y, m):
  r <- Z_q
  R := g^r
  C := m * y^r
  return (R, C)

Dec(x, (R, C)):
  m' := C / R^x
  return m'
```

- Already multiplicatively homomorphic
- But mapping of integers to and from elements of G can be hard
- And additively homomorphic is preferred

## Additively homomorphic ElGamal

- Use textbook ElGamal
- Works only for small plaintexts, numbers from eg 0 to max, where `max << q`

```
KeyGen():
  As before -> (y, x)

AM-Enc(y, a): // for a in [0, max], or [-max, max]
  return Enc(y, g^a)

AM-Dec(x, (R, C)):
  h := Dec(x, (R, C)) // h = g^i for some i, with i in [0, max]
  for i := 0 .. max:
    if g^i = h:
      return i

  // Should not happen, invalid ciphertext or i outside valid range
  return ERROR
```

Operation x is component-wise multiplication. Then:
```
AM-ENC(y, a) x AM-Enc(y, b)
= (Ra, Ca) x (Rb, Cb)
= (Ra * Rb, Ca * Cb)
= AM-Enc(y, (a+b) mod q)
```

NB:
 - `q ~ 2^256` (security requirement) // PS
 - `max ~ 10^6` (performance limitations)
 - a, b in `[-max / 2, max / 2]` using `a' = q + a` for `a < 0`

## Voting protocol using additive homomorphic encryption

- Parties `P_1, ..., P_n`
- Each party `P_i` votes `v_i in {-1, +1}`
- One authority `A`

1. A generates `(pk, sk) = KeyGen()`
   A sends `pk` to `P_i` forall i
2. A computes `c_0 = Enc(pk, 0)` and sends `c_0` to `P_1`

   For `i = 1 .. n`:
     - `P_i` receives `c_{i-1}`
     - `P_i` computes `c_i := c_{i-1} x Enc(y, v_i)`
     - `P_i` sends `c_i` to `P_{i+1}` (`P_n` sends to `A` instead)

3. A receives `c_n` from `P_n`
   Computes `z := Dec(x, c_n)`
   A publishes z

### Remarks:

- Adversaries: Authority and participants, try to find out what other participant vote.
- Communication between participants must be secure point-to-point channels.
  Else an adversary observing `c_i`, `c_{i+1}` can figure out what `P_{i+1}`
  voted.
- Not robust against even single malicious participant:
  - Could add values other than 0 or 1.
  - Could refuse to send value or send arbitrary value

Defense exists for all these:
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Public bulletin board for communication
- Distributed implementation of A using a group of admins

Helios implements most of this (heliosvoting.org)

# 5 Zero-knowledge proofs

- How to prove a statement true without giving away more information
- How to prove knowledge of a password without giving information about it
- Applications in cryptographic protocols

## Two kinds of proofs

- Proof for statements
  - Given a boolean formula phi in n variables, there exists an assignment such that phi = true
  - Given two graphs G0, G1, they are isomorphic
  - Given a graph G, there exists a Hamiltonian circuit in G
  - Given a graph G there is a 3-coloring of G

- Proof of knowledge
  - Given y (public key DH), "I know" x such that y = g^x
  - Given h, "I know" an x such that H(x) = h
  - Given N, "I know" p, q such that N = p*q

## Model (proofs of statements)

- Back and forth between proofer P and verifier V.
- In the end outputs true or false (verifier accepts ore refuses)
- Inherently probabilistic, to prevent cheating

Requirements:
- 1) Completness: If S holds, prover P correct, V correct, then verifier
  accepts
- 2) Soundness: If S is false, then an honest V will reject with at least a
  constant probability, no matter what the (faulty / malicious) prover does
- 1) and 2) == Requirements for interactive proof (IP)
- 3) Zero-knowledge: The verifier does not learn more than the truth of the
  statement

### ZKP for graph isomorphisms

P and V are given two graphs `G_0 = (V, E_0)`, `G_1 = (V, E_1)`. P knows an
isomorphism between `G_0` and `G_1`, ie a bijective function `F: V -> V` such
that `Forall v, w in V: (v, w) in E_0 <=> (f(v), f(w)) in E_1`

Protocol:
```
1) P will chose a random permutation Pi on V, and computes H = (V, F) such that H
is isomorphic to G_0, ie:
  (v, w) in E_0 <=> (pi(v), pi(w)) in F

P sends H to V
// H is a random choice from all graphs isomorphic to G_0. V could have
// simulated one such graph itself

2) V chooses random bit b, sends b to proofer

3) P shows the isomorphism Rho between G_b and H

P sends Rho = 
  If b = 0 => Pi
  If b = 1 => Pi(f^{-1})

4) V checks if G_b is isomorphic to H:
  Forall v, w in V: (v, w) in E_b <=> (Rho(v), Rho(w)) in H
```

In each iteration, a cheating prover is caught with probability 1/2. In n rounds chance of a prover being able to cheat = (1/2)^n
