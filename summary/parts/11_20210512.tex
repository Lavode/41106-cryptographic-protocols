\section{Secure multiparty computation (MPC)}

So far we used boolean circuits. Now: Arithmetic circuits over a finite field
$GF(q)$ with $+$ and $\cdot$ operations.

\subsection{Theorem}

For every function $f : \{0, 1\}^* \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ computed by a boolean
circuit $C_B$, there exists an arithmetic circuit $C_A$ which also computes
$f$. The size of $C_A$ is proportional to the one of $C_B$.

\subsection{BGW protocol: MPC with unconditional security}

Recall GMW protocol for 2PC with unconditional security. Overview of MPC:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use $f+1$-of-$n$ secret sharing for all wires: $w \leftrightarrow (w_1,
    \ldots, w_n) = [w]$
  \item Implement each gate of circuit
  \item To provide inputs, $P_i$ shares its input $x_i \leftrightarrow
    (x_{i,1}, \ldots, x_{i, n})$
  \item To obtain output, each party releases its share of output
  \item Communication assumes secure channels between all parties, and a
    broadcast channel
  \item Semi-honest model with up to $f$ honest-but-curious
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Share input values}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $P_i$ shares $x_i \leftrightarrow (x_{i,1}, \ldots, x_{i, n})$
  \item For each wire $w_i$, parties hold $[w_i]$
\end{itemize}

Notation: $[w_i] = [w_{i, 1}, \ldots, w_{i, n}$, with $w_{i, j} = a_i(j)$.
($j$'s share of wire $i$).

\subsubsection{Evaluate gates}

Using a topological order

\paragraph{Addition gate}

Goal: $[w_t] = [w_j] + [w_k]$

\begin{align*}
  [w_t] & = [w_j] + [w_k] \\
        & = (a_j(1), \ldots, a_j(n)) + (a_k(1), \ldots, a_k(n)) \\
        & = (a_j(1) + a_k(1), \ldots, a_j(n) + a_k(n)) \\
        & = [w_j + w_k]
\end{align*}

Fully local operations, then each party has its share of $[w_j + w_k]$.

\paragraph{Multiplication-by-constant gate}

Goal: $[w_t] = \gamma \cdot [w_j]$.

\begin{align*}
  [w_t] & = \gamma \cdot [w_j] \\
        & = \gamma \cdot (w_{j, 1}, \ldots, w_{j, n}) \\
        & = (\gamma \cdot w_{j, 1}, \ldots, \gamma \cdot w_{j, n}) \\
        & = [\gamma \cdot w_j]
\end{align*}

Again fully local operations.

\paragraph{Multiplication gate}

Goal: $[w_t] = [w_j \cdot w_k]$.

$P_i$ first locally computes $h_{t,i} = w_{j, i} \cdot w_{k, i}$. Notice now
that $h_{t,1}, \ldots, h_{t, n}$ define a polynomial $b_t(x)$ such that $b_t(i)
= h_{t, i} = w_{j, i} \cdot w_{k, i} = a_j(i) \cdot a_k(i)$ has degree $2f$.

Observe that $b_t(0) = a_j(0) \cdot a_k(0) = w_j \cdot w_k = w_t$. That is it
is a valid sharing of the output wire, but with too high a degree. Issue:
Chained multiplication gates would cause degree to escalate.

There exist lagrange coefficients such that $w_t = b_t(0) = \sum_{i=1}^{2f + 1}
\lambda_i \cdot b_t(i)$.

This is evaluated using another `shared' computation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $P_i$ shares $h_{t, i} \leftrightarrow (h_{t, i, 1}, \ldots, h_{t, i, n})$
  \item Parties now hold $[h_{t, 1}], \ldots, [h_{t, n}]$
  \item Parties locally compute $[w_t] = \sum_{i=1}^{2f+1} \lambda_i \cdot [h_{t, i}] = [\sum_{i=1}^{2f + 1} \lambda_i \cdot h_{t_i}]$
  \item This now is a new $f+1$-of-$n$ sharing of $w_t$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Output reconstruction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For each output wire $o$, parties hold $[w_0]$.
  \item $P_i$ broadcasts its share $w_{o, i}$
  \item $P_i$ receives enough shares to reconstruct $w_o$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cost}

\begin{description}
  \item[Public-key operations] $O$ (unconditional)
  \item[Communication bits] $O(|C| \cdot n^2)$
  \item[Communication rounds] $O(depth(C))$
\end{description}
